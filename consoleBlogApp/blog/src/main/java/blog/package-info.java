/**
 * This package contains the core components of a blog application.
 *
 * The blog application allows users to view, add, modify, and delete posts 
 * using a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring separation of concerns.
 *
 * Structure:
 * - Model: Classes for data representation and logic, like Post and PostRepository.
 * - View: Classes for user interaction, like PostView and MenuView.
 * - Controller: The PostController class mediates between the Model and View.
 *
 * The application supports both command line arguments and interactive input, 
 * with error handling for missing posts.
